# Helm chart proxy for OCI only artifacts
This repo is a manually updated mirror of OCI-Only helm charts with the added metadata
for using it as a proper helm repository.  
I created it, as the OCI integration in helm is still very poor and breaks a lot of workflows.

## Currently deployed
n8n from the [oci://8gears.container-registry.com/library/n8n Repository](oci://8gears.container-registry.com/library/n8n).
paperless-ngx from the [wrenix Repository](https://git.chaos.fyi/wrenix/helm-charts/src/branch/main/paperless-ngx).
